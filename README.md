# Snakes
Basic snakes game is developed on python 2 for implementing and understanding the different functions of pygame module .
All of the features of the traditional game were kept in mind. For example apples will appear in randon locations on the screen and the length of the snake will increase after eating every one of them. Your snake will die if it touches itself or if touches the wall
I have also added some intermediate files to provide better understanding of code and its working.
